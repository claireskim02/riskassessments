This is a series of statistical investigations and trials to detect risk on/off signals which I worked on throughout my internship with Plain Vanilla Investments' algorithm team based in South Korea. 

I tried to look at different aspects of the market throughout this project: first looking at price to earnings ratios, then looking at signals in the derivatives market, and lastly looking into the RSI and market divergence/convergence. 

For each aspect, I looked into at least two different indices or economic indicators to build my models. In specific, in the price to earnings ratio investigation, I looked at both backward and forward PERs.For signals in the derivatives market, I looked at CBOE's SKEW index and the Put-Call Ratio. Lastly, I looked at trends of the RSI based on market direction in times of price divergence. 

All investigations were based/tried on data sourced from Bloomberg Terminal on the SPX index.
